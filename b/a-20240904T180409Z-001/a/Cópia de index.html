            <p>Victoria's Secret Fashion Shows: A Spectacle of Glamour and Controversy
                For over two decades, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show captivated global audiences with its extravagant displays of lingerie, fashion, and entertainment. Held annually from the late 1990s to 2018, the show became synonymous with opulence and fantasy, showcasing elaborate lingerie collections and featuring top models dubbed "Angels."
                At its peak, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was a cultural phenomenon. It blended high fashion with celebrity performances, creating a spectacle that attracted millions of viewers worldwide.
                 The shows were meticulously choreographed, featuring iconic themes and elaborate runway setups that often included angel wings and fantasy-inspired costumes.
                The inclusion of renowned models like Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks, and Adriana Lima helped define beauty standards and catapulted many careers to stardom. 
                These models, known as Victoria's Secret Angels, became household names and were integral to the show's allure and appeal.
                However, despite its success, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show faced mounting criticism over the years. Critics argued that the show perpetuated unrealistic beauty ideals, objectified women, and lacked diversity in its casting.</p>
